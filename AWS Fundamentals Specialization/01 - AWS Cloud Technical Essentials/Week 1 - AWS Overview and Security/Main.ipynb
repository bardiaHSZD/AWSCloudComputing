They needed to allocate entire infrastructure departments to take care of them, resulting in a costly operation that made some workloads and experimentation impossible.\n","\n","As internet usage became more widespread, the demand for compute, storage, and networking equipment increased. For some companies and organizations, the cost of maintaining a large physical presence was unsustainable. To solve this problem, cloud computing was created.\n","\n","Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. You no longer have to manage and maintain your own hardware in your own data centers. Companies like AWS own and maintain these data centers and provide virtualized data center technologies and services to users over the internet.\n","\n","To help differentiate between running workloads on-premises versus in the cloud, consider the scenario where your developers need to deploy a new feature on your application. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the exact same configurations as production.\n","\n","If you run your application on-premises, creating this additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. All of these tasks can be time-consuming and take days to perform. Meanwhile, the new product feature’s time-to-market is increasing and your developers are waiting for this environment. \n","\n","If you ran your application in the cloud, you can replicate the entire environment as often as needed in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, you can logically manage your physical infrastructure over the internet. \n","\n","Using cloud computing not only saves you time from the set-up perspective, but it also removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting. If you look at any application, you’ll see that some of the aspects of it are very important to your business, like the code. However, there are other aspects that are no different than any other application you might make: for instance the compute the code runs on. By removing repetitive common tasks that don’t differentiate your business, like installing virtual machines, or storing backups, you can focus on what is strategically unique to your business and let AWS handle the tasks that are time consuming and don’t separate you from your competitors. \n","\n","So where does AWS fit into all of this? Well AWS simply just provides cloud computing services. Those IT resources mentioned in the cloud computing definition are AWS services in this case. We’ll need to use these AWS services to architect a scalable, highly available, and cost effective infrastructure to host our corporate directory application. This way we can get our corporate directory app out into the world quickly, without having to manage any heavy-duty physical hardware. There are the six main advantages to running your workloads on AWS.\n","\n","**The Six Benefits of Cloud Computing**\n","\n","Pay as you go. Instead of investing in data centers and hardware before you know how you are going to use them, you pay only when you use computing resources, and pay only for how much you use.\n","\n","Benefit from massive economies of scale. By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\n","\n","Stop guessing capacity. Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.\n","\n","Increase speed and agility. IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.\n","\n","Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers. Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure. This is often referred to as undifferentiated heavy lifting.\n","\n","Go global in minutes. Easily deploy your application in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-13-20-41.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-13-21-34.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-13-22-46.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-13-23-27.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**To cache content from edge locations, one can use**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-13-27-48.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-02-46.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-03-10.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-03-50.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-05-03.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-05-45.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-06-05.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-06-50.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Another tool to interact with AWS API is the SDKs:**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-10-05.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-14-14-24.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**THE AWS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI)**\n","\n","Consider the scenario where you run tens of servers on AWS for your application’s frontend. You want to run a report to collect data from all of these servers. You need to do this programmatically every day because the server details may change. Instead of manually logging into the AWS Management Console and copying/pasting information, you can schedule an AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) script with an API call to pull this data for you.The AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them with scripts. The AWS CLI is open-source, and there are installers available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.Here is an example of running an API call against a service using the AWS CLI: \n","\n","You get this response:\n","\n","{\n","\n","\"Reservations\": [\n","\n","{\"Groups\": [],\n","\n","\"Instances\": [\n","\n","{\"AmiLaunchIndex\": 0,\n","\n","and so on.\n","\n","**AWS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS (SDKS)**\n","\n","API calls to AWS can also be performed by executing code with programming languages. You can do this by using AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs).

MFA introduces an additional unique piece of information that you need to enter to gain access to the account. There are a variety of devices, virtual or physical, that generate one-time passwords that can be integrated with your AWS account for MFA. For example, I personally use a virtual MFA device that is an app on my phone. This app produces a string of numbers for one time use that I type into the console after I log in using my email address and password. Even if someone guessed the password, they cannot gain access to the account without the numbers generated by the virtual MFA device. No matter what type of MFA device that you choose to use, and I will include a link to the supported devices and the readings for you to look into, the most important thing is that you are using MFA on the root user. That way, even if someone, the nefarious actor, cracks your password, they still cannot gain access to your account. All thanks to MFA. On top of enabling MFA for the root user, we strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. There are really only a few actions that require root user access. Coming up, you'll learn how to create an IAM user, and use that to log into your AWS account instead of using the root user."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Understand Authentication**\n","\n","When you create your AWS account, you use a combination of an email address and a password to verify your identity. If the user types in the correct email and password, the system assumes the user is allowed to enter and grants them access. This is the process of authentication.Authentication ensures that the user is who they say they are. Usernames and passwords are the most common types of authentication, but you may also work with other forms, such as token-based authentication or biometric data like a fingerprint. Authentication simply answers the question, “Are you who you say you are?”\n","\n","**Understand Authorization**\n","\n","Once you’re inside your AWS account, you might be curious about what actions you can take. This is where authorization comes in. Authorization is the process of giving users permission to access AWS resources and services. Authorization determines whether the user can perform an action—whether it be to read, edit, delete, or create resources. Authorization answers the question, “What actions can you perform?” \n","\n","**What Is the AWS Root User?**\n","\n","When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.\n","\n","**Understand the AWS Root User Credentials**\n","\n","The AWS root user has two sets of credentials associated with it. One set of credentials is the email address and password used to create the account. This allows you to access the AWS Management Console. The second set of credentials is called access keys, which allow you to make programmatic requests from the \n","AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API\n",".  Access keys consist of two parts:\n","\n","An access key ID, for example, A2lAl5EXAMPLE\n","A secret access key, for example, wJalrFE/KbEKxE\n","Similar to a username and password combination, you need both the access key ID and secret access key to authenticate your requests via the AWS CLI or AWS API. Access keys should be managed with the same security as an email address and password.\n","\n","**Follow Best Practices When Working with the AWS Root User**\n","\n","Keep in mind that the root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in your account, as well as your billing and personal information. Due to this, securely lock away the credentials associated with the root user and do not use the root user for everyday tasks.  To ensure the safety of the root user:\n","\n","Choose a strong password for the root user.\n","Never share your root user password or access keys with anyone.\n","Disable or delete the access keys associated with the root user.\n","Do not use the root user for administrative tasks or everyday tasks.\n","When is it OK to use the AWS root user? There are some tasks where it makes sense to use the AWS root user. Check out the links at the end of this section to read about them.\n","\n","**Delete Your Keys to Stay Safe**\n","\n","If you don't already have an access key for your AWS account root user, don't create one unless you absolutely need to. If you do have an access key for your AWS account root user and want to delete the keys:\n","\n","Go to the \n"," My Security Credentials page\n"," in the AWS Management Console and sign in with the root user’s email address and password.\n","Open the Access keys section.\n","Under Actions, click Delete.\n","Click Yes.\n","The Case for Multi-Factor Authentication\n","\n","When you create an AWS account and first log in to that account, you use single-factor authentication. Single-factor authentication is the simplest and most common form of authentication. It only requires one authentication method. In this case, you use a username and password to authenticate as the AWS root user. Other forms of single-factor authentication include a security pin or a security token.However, sometimes a user’s password is easy to guess. \n","\n","For example, your coworker Bob’s password, IloveCats222, might be easy for someone who knows Bob personally to guess, because it’s a combination of information that is easy to remember and describes certain things about Bob (1. Bob loves cats, and 2. Bob’s birthday is February 22).\n","\n","If a bad actor guessed or cracked Bob’s password through social engineering, bots, or scripts, Bob might lose control of his account. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario that users of any website often face.\n","\n","This is why using MFA has become so important in preventing unwanted account access. MFA requires two or more authentication methods to verify an identity, pulling from three different categories of information.\n","\n","Something you know, such as a username and password, or pin number\n","Something you have, such as a one-time passcode from a hardware device or mobile app\n","Something you are, such as fingerprint or face scanning technology\n","Using a combination of this information enables systems to provide a layered approach to account access. Even though the first method of authentication, Bob’s password, was cracked by a malicious user, it’s very unlikely that a second method of authentication, such as a fingerprint, would also be cracked. This extra layer of security is needed when protecting your most sacred accounts, which is why it’s important to enable MFA on your AWS root user."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-03-20.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **AWS Identity and Access Management**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-40-40.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-50-28.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-55-08.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-55-45.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-57-06.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-58-08.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-00-18.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-19-59-50.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-01-23.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-01-45.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-02-07.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-02-37.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-03-29.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-04-12.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-04-20-04-37.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","**WHAT IS IAM?**\n","\n","IAM is a web service that enables you to manage access to your AWS account and resources. It also provides a centralized view of who and what are allowed inside your AWS account (authentication), and who and what have permissions to use and work with your AWS resources (authorization).With IAM, you can share access to an AWS account and resources without having to share your set of access keys or password. You can also provide granular access to those working in your account, so that people and services only have permissions to the resources they need. For example, to provide a user of your AWS account with read-only access to a particular AWS service, you can granularly select which actions and which resources in that service they can access.\n","\n","**GET TO KNOW THE IAM FEATURES**\n","\n","To help control access and manage identities within your AWS account, IAM offers many features to ensure security.\n","\n","IAM is global and not specific to any one Region. This means you can see and use your IAM configurations from any Region in the AWS Management Console.\n","IAM is integrated with many AWS services \n","by default\n",".\n","You can establish password policies in IAM to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for users.\n","IAM supports MFA.\n","IAM supports identity federation, which allows users who already have passwords elsewhere—for example, in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider—to get temporary access to your AWS account.\n","Any AWS customer can use IAM; the service is offered at no additional charge.\n","\n","**WHAT IS AN IAM USER?**\n","\n","An IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS. You define the user within your AWS account. And any activity done by that user is billed to your account. Once you create a user, that user can sign in to gain access to the AWS resources inside your account.You can also add more users to your account as needed. For example, for your cat photo application, you could create individual users in your AWS account that correspond to the people who are working on your application. Each person should have their own login credentials. Providing users with their own login credentials prevents sharing of credentials.\n","\n","**IAM USER CREDENTIALS**\n","\n","An IAM user consists of a name and a set of credentials. When creating a user, you can choose to provide the user:\n","\n","Access to the AWS Management Console\n","Programmatic access to the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS Application Programming Interface (AWS API)\n","To access the AWS Management Console, provide the users with a user name and password. For programmatic access, AWS generates a set of access keys that can be used with the AWS CLI and AWS API. IAM user credentials are considered permanent, in that they stay with the user until there’s a forced rotation by admins.When you create an IAM user, you have the option to grant permissions directly at the user level.This can seem like a good idea if you have only one or a few users. However, as the number of users helping you build your solutions on AWS increases, it becomes more complicated to keep up with permissions. For example, if you have 3,000 users in your AWS account, administering access becomes challenging, and it’s impossible to get a top-level view of who can perform what actions on which resources.If only there were a way to group IAM users and attach permissions at the group level instead. Guess what: There is!\n","\n","**WHAT IS AN IAM GROUP?**\n","\n","An IAM group is a collection of users. All users in the group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. This makes it easy to give permissions to multiple users at once. It’s a more convenient and scalable way of managing permissions for users in your AWS account. This is why using IAM groups is a best practice.If you have a an application that you’re trying to build and have multiple users in one account working on the application, you might decide to organize these users by job function. You might want IAM groups organized by developers, security, and admins. You would then place all of your IAM users in the respective group for their job function.This provides a better view to see who has what permissions within your organization and an easier way to scale as new people join, leave, and change roles in your organization.Consider the following examples.\n","\n","A new developer joins your AWS account to help with your application. You simply create a new user and add them to the developer group, without having to think about which permissions they need.\n","A developer changes jobs and becomes a security engineer. Instead of editing the user’s permissions directly, you can instead remove them from the old group and add them to the new group that already has the correct level of access.\n","Keep in mind the following features of groups.\n","\n","Groups can have many users.\n","Users can belong to many groups.\n","Groups cannot belong to groups.\n","The root user can perform all actions on all resources inside an AWS account by default. This is in contrast to creating new IAM users, new groups, or new roles. New IAM identities can perform no actions inside your AWS account by default until you explicitly grant them permission.The way you grant permissions in IAM is by using IAM policies.\n","\n","**WHAT IS AN IAM POLICY?**\n","\n","To manage access and provide permissions to AWS services and resources, you create IAM policies and attach them to IAM users, groups, and roles. Whenever a user or role makes a request, AWS evaluates the policies associated with them. For example, if you have a developer inside the developers group who makes a request to an AWS service, AWS evaluates any policies attached to the developers group and any policies attached to the developer user to determine if the request should be allowed or denied.\n","\n","**IAM POLICY EXAMPLES**\n","\n","Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents with several policy elements. Take a look at the following example of what providing admin access through an IAM identity-based policy looks like.\n","\n","{\n","\n","\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",    \n","\n","     \"Statement\": [{        \n","          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",        \n","\n","          \"Action\": \"*\",        \n","\n","          \"Resource\": \"*\"     \n","\n","     }]\n","\n","}\n","\n","In this policy, there are four major JSON elements: Version, Effect, Action, and Resource.\n","\n","The Version element defines the version of the policy language. It specifies the language syntax rules that are needed by AWS to process a policy. To use all the available policy features, include \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\" before the \"Statement\" element in all your policies.\n","The Effect element specifies whether the statement will allow or deny access. In this policy, the Effect is \"Allow\", which means you’re providing access to a particular resource.\n","The Action element describes the type of action that should be allowed or denied. In the above policy, the action is \"*\". This is called a wildcard, and it is used to symbolize every action inside your AWS account.\n","The Resource element specifies the object or objects that the policy statement covers. In the policy example above, the resource is also the wildcard \"*\".

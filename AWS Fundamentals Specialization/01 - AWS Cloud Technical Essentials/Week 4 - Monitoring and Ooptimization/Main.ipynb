The act of collecting, analyzing, and using data to make decisions or answer questions about your IT resources and systems is called monitoring.   Monitoring enables you to have a near real-time pulse on your system and answer the questions listed above. You can use the data you collect to watch for operational issues caused by events like over-utilization of resources, application flaws, resource misconfiguration, or security-related events.   Think of the data collected through monitoring as outputs of the system, or metrics.\n","\n","**Use Metrics to Solve Problems**\n","\n","The resources that host your solutions on AWS all create various forms of data that you might be interested in collecting. You can think of each individual data point that is created by a resource as a metric. Metrics that are collected and analyzed over time become statistics, like the example of average CPU utilization over time below, showing a spike at 1:30.  Consider this: One way to evaluate the health of an Amazon EC2 instance is through CPU utilization. Generally speaking, if an EC2 instance has a high CPU utilization, it can mean a flood of requests. Or it can reflect a process that has encountered an error and is consuming too much of the CPU. When analyzing CPU utilization, take a process that exceeds a specific threshold for an unusual length of time. Use that abnormal event as a cue to either manually or automatically resolve the issue through actions like scaling the instance.  This is one example of a metric. Other examples of metrics EC2 instances have are network utilization, disk performance, memory utilization, and the logs created by the applications running on top of EC2.\n","\n","**Know the Different Types of Metrics**\n","\n","Different resources in AWS create different types of metrics. An Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket would not have CPU utilization like an EC2 instance does. Instead, S3 creates metrics related to the objects stored in a bucket like the overall size, or the number of objects in a bucket. S3 also has metrics related to the requests made to the bucket such as reading or writing objects.  Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) creates metrics such as database connections, CPU utilization of an instance, or disk space consumption. This is not a complete list for any of the services mentioned, but you can see how different resources create different metrics.   You could be interested in a wide variety of metrics depending on the types of resources you are using, the goals you have, or the types of questions you want answered.\n","\n","**Understand the Benefits of Monitoring**\n","\n","Monitoring gives you visibility into your resources, but the question now is, \"Why is that important?\" The following are some of the benefits of monitoring.  \n","\n","**Respond to operational issues proactively before your end users are aware of them.** It’s a bad practice to wait for end users to let you know your application is experiencing an outage. Through monitoring, you can keep tabs on metrics like error response rate or request latency, over time, that help signal that an outage is going to occur. This enables you to automatically or manually perform actions to prevent the outage from happening—fixing the problem before your end users are aware of it.  \n","\n","**Improve the performance and reliability of your resources.** Monitoring the different resources that comprise your application provides you with a full picture of how your solution behaves as a system. Monitoring, if done well, can illuminate bottlenecks and inefficient architectures. This enables you to drive performance and reliability improvement processes.  \n","\n","**Recognize security threats and events.** When you monitor resources, events, and systems over time, you create what is called a baseline. A baseline defines what activity is normal. Using a baseline, you can spot anomalies like unusual traffic spikes or unusual IP addresses accessing your resources. When an anomaly occurs, an alert can be sent out or an action can be taken to investigate the event.  \n","\n","**Make data-driven decisions for your business.** Monitoring is not only to keep an eye on IT operational health. It also helps drive business decisions. For example, let’s say you launched a new feature for your cat photo app, and want to know whether it’s being used. You can collect application-level metrics and view the number of users who use the new feature. With your findings, you decide whether to invest more time into improving the new feature.  \n","\n","**Create more cost-effective solutions.** Through monitoring, you can view resources that are being underutilized and rightsize your resources to your usage. This helps you optimize cost and make sure you aren’t spending more money than necessary.\n","\n","**Enable Visibility**\n","\n","AWS resources create data you can monitor through metrics, logs, network traffic, events, and more. This data is coming from components that are distributed in nature, which can lead to difficulty in collecting the data you need if you don’t have a centralized place to review it all. AWS has already done that for you with a service called Amazon CloudWatch.   \n","\n","Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects data like those mentioned in this module. CloudWatch provides actionable insights into your applications, and enables you to respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. This unified view is important.  You can use CloudWatch to:\n","\n","- Detect anomalous behavior in your environments.\n","\n","- Set alarms to alert you when something’s not right.\n","\n","- Visualize logs and metrics with the AWS Management Console.\n","\n","- Take automated actions like scaling.\n","\n","- Troubleshoot issues.\n","\n","- Discover insights to keep your applications healthy.\n","\n","**Resource:**\n","\n","- External Site: AWS: Amazon CloudWatch\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-42-07.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-42-40.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-43-25.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-43-43.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-44-02.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-44-36.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-45-00.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-45-34.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-46-03.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-46-38.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-47-37.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-47-58.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-48-25.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-48-43.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-52-40.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-53-15.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-53-29.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-53-41.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-53-54.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-54-17.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-54-41.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-55-16.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-55-34.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-55-53.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-56-13.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-56-27.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2023-12-12-20-56-55.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**How CloudWatch Works**\n","\n","The great thing about CloudWatch is that all you need to get started is an AWS account. It is a managed service, which enables you to focus on monitoring, without managing any underlying infrastructure.   \n","\n","The employee directory app is built with various AWS services working together as building blocks. It would be difficult to monitor all of these different services independently, so CloudWatch acts as one centralized place where metrics are gathered and analyzed. You already learned how EC2 instances post CPU utilization as a metric to CloudWatch. Different AWS resources post different metrics that you can monitor. You can view a list of services that send metrics to CloudWatch in the resources section of this unit.  \n","\n","Many AWS services send metrics automatically for free to CloudWatch at a rate of one data point per metric per 5-minute interval, without you needing to do anything to turn on that data collection. This by itself gives you visibility into your systems without you needing to spend any extra money to do so. This is known as basic monitoring. For many applications, basic monitoring does the job.   \n","\n","For applications running on EC2 instances, you can get more granularity by posting metrics every minute instead of every 5 minutes using a feature like detailed monitoring. Detailed monitoring has an extra fee associated. You can read about pricing on the CloudWatch Pricing Page linked in the resources section of this unit.\n","\n","**Break Down Metrics**\n","\n","Each metric in CloudWatch has a timestamp and is organized into containers called namespaces. Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other—you can think of them as belonging to different categories.  \n","\n","AWS services that send data to CloudWatch attach dimensions to each metric. A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the metric’s identity. You can use dimensions to filter the results that CloudWatch returns. For example, you can get statistics for a specific EC2 instance by specifying the InstanceId dimension when you search.\n","\n","**Set Up Custom Metrics**\n","\n","Let’s say for your application you wanted to record the number of page views your website gets. How would you record this metric to CloudWatch? It’s an application-level metric, meaning that it’s not something the EC2 instance would post to CloudWatch by default. This is where custom metrics come in. Custom metrics allows you to publish your own metrics to CloudWatch.  \n","\n","If you want to gain more granular visibility, you can use high-resolution custom metrics, which enable you to collect custom metrics down to a 1-second resolution. This means you can send one data point per second per custom metric.  Other examples of custom metrics are: \n","\n","    Web page load times\n","\n","    Request error rates\n","\n","    Number of processes or threads on your instance\n","\n","    Amount of work performed by your application\n","\n","Note: You can get started with custom metrics by programmatically sending the metric to CloudWatch using the PutMetricData API.\n","\n","**Understand the CloudWatch Dashboards**\n","\n","Once you’ve provisioned your AWS resources and they are sending metrics to CloudWatch, you can then visualize and review that data using the CloudWatch console with dashboards. Dashboards are customizable home pages that you use for data visualization for one or more metrics through the use of widgets, such as a graph or text.   \n","\n","You can build many custom dashboards, each one focusing on a distinct view of your environment. You can even pull data from different Regions into a single dashboard in order to create a global view of your architecture.   \n","\n","CloudWatch aggregates statistics according to the period of time that you specify when creating your graph or requesting your metrics. You can also choose whether your metric widgets display live data. Live data is data published within the last minute that has not been fully aggregated.   \n","\n","You are not bound to using CloudWatch exclusively for all your visualization needs. You can use external or custom tools to ingest and analyze CloudWatch metrics using the GetMetricData API.  \n","\n","As far as security goes, you can control who has access to view or manage your CloudWatch dashboards through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that get associated with IAM users, IAM groups, or IAM roles.\n","Get to Know CloudWatch Logs\n","\n","CloudWatch can also be the centralized place for logs to be stored and analyzed, using CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs can monitor, store, and access your log files from applications running on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, and other sources.  \n","\n","CloudWatch Logs allows you to query and filter your log data. For example, let’s say you’re looking into an application logic error for your application, and you know that when this error occurs it will log the stack trace. Since you know it logs the error, you query your logs in CloudWatch Logs to find the stack trace. You also set up metric filters on logs, which turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics that you graph and use on your dashboards.  \n","\n","Some services are set up to send log data to CloudWatch Logs with minimal effort, like AWS Lambda. With AWS Lambda, all you need to do is give the Lambda function the correct IAM permissions to post logs to CloudWatch Logs. Other services require more configuration. For example, if you want to send your application logs from an EC2 instance into CloudWatch Logs, you need to first install and configure the CloudWatch Logs agent on the EC2 instance.  \n","\n","The CloudWatch Logs agent enables Amazon EC2 instances to automatically send log data to CloudWatch Logs. The agent includes the following components.\n","\n","    A plug-in to the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) that pushes log data to CloudWatch Logs.\n","\n","    A script that initiates the process to push data to CloudWatch Logs.\n","\n","    A cron job that ensures the daemon is always running.\n","\n","After the agent is installed and configured, you can then view your application logs in CloudWatch Logs. \n","\n","**Learn the CloudWatch Logs Terminology**\n","\n","Log data sent to CloudWatch Logs can come from different sources, so it’s important you understand how they’re organized and the terminology used to describe your logs.  \n","\n","**Log event:** A log event is a record of activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored, and it has a timestamp and an event message.  \n","\n","**Log stream:** Log events are then grouped into log streams, which are sequences of log events that all belong to the same resource being monitored. For example, logs for an EC2 instance are grouped together into a log stream that you can then filter or query for insights.  \n","\n","**Log groups:** Log streams are then organized into log groups. A log group is composed of log streams that all share the same retention and permissions settings. For example, if you have multiple EC2 instances hosting your application and you are sending application log data to CloudWatch Logs, you can group the log streams from each instance into one log group. This helps keep your logs organized.\n","\n","**Configure a CloudWatch Alarm**\n","\n","You can create CloudWatch alarms to automatically initiate actions based on sustained state changes of your metrics. You configure when alarms are triggered and the action that is performed.   \n","\n","You first need to decide what metric you want to set up an alarm for, then you define the threshold at which you want the alarm to trigger. Next, you define the specified time period of which the metric should cross the threshold for the alarm to be triggered.   \n","\n","For example, if you wanted to set up an alarm for an EC2 instance to trigger when the CPU utilization goes over a threshold of 80%, you also need to specify the time period the CPU utilization is over the threshold. You don’t want to trigger an alarm based on short temporary spikes in the CPU. You only want to trigger an alarm if the CPU is elevated for a sustained amount of time, for example if it is over 80% for 5 minutes or longer, when there is a potential resource issue.   \n","\n","Keeping all that in mind, to set up an alarm you need to choose the metric, the threshold, and the time period. An alarm has three possible states.\n","\n","    **OK:** The metric is within the defined threshold. Everything appears to be operating like normal.\n","\n","    **ALARM:** The metric is outside of the defined threshold. This could be an operational issue.\n","\n","    **INSUFFICIENT_DATA:** The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.\n","\n","An alarm can be triggered when it transitions from one state to another. Once an alarm is triggered, it can initiate an action. Actions can be an Amazon EC2 action, an Auto Scaling action, or a notification sent to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).\n","\n","**Use CloudWatch Alarms to Prevent and Troubleshoot Issues**\n","\n","CloudWatch Logs uses metric filters to turn the log data into metrics that you can graph or set an alarm on. For the employee directory application, let’s say you set up a metric filter for 500-error response codes.   \n","\n","Then, you define an alarm for that metric that will go into the ALARM state if 500-error responses go over a certain amount for a sustained time period. Let’s say if it’s more than five 500-error responses per hour, the alarm should enter the ALARM state. Next, you define an action that you want to take place when the alarm is triggered.   \n","\n","In this case, it makes sense to send an email or text alert to you so you can start troubleshooting the website, hopefully fixing it before it becomes a bigger issue. Once the alarm is set up, you feel comfortable knowing that if the error happens again, you’ll be notified promptly.  \n","\n","You can set up different alarms for different reasons to help you prevent or troubleshoot operational issues. In the scenario just described, the alarm triggered an SNS notification that went to a person who looked into the issue manually. Another option is to have alarms trigger actions that automatically remediate technical issues.   \n","\n","For example, you can set up an alarm to trigger an EC2 instance to reboot, or scale services up or down. You can even set up an alarm to trigger an SNS notification, which then triggers an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function then calls any AWS API to manage your resources, and troubleshoot operational issues. By using AWS services together like this, you respond to events more quickly.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Optimization**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Exercise and Assessment**"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNAnc3IBjNxONndNFHGocAe","collapsed_sections":[],"name":"M1Assignment1 Solution.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

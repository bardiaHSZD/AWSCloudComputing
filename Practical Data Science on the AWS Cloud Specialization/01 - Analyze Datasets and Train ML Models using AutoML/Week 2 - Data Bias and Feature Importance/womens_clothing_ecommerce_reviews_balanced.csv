-1,Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.,Blouses
-1,Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different ,Blouses
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",Blouses
-1,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,Blouses
-1,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.,Blouses
-1,One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide.,Blouses
-1,I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.,Blouses
-1,This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.,Blouses
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!",Blouses
0,This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.,Blouses
0,Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front  but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft  but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look  but sadly this is going back.,Blouses
0,"This top is super cute  however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!",Blouses
0,This top is much stiffer  more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too  and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun  drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.,Blouses
0,This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.,Blouses
0,I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,Blouses
0,I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.,Blouses
1,I had to go up one size  but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work  and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest  but the next size up fit perfect!,Blouses
1,I'm an xl in retailer tops  and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back  and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down.   -  i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model  but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck,Blouses
1,Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.,Blouses
1,I am on the fence with this one.......the black lace on the bottom is beautiful and pairs so well with my black velvet gladiator sandals..... but it came very wrinkled  and the fabric almost feels more like a cheap cotton. i am always in between a sm and med  so tried the small. the shoulders do want to slide up a bit. arms need to be down.  it is very voluminous......and falls below my bottom. would make a pretty maternity top!! the idea of it overall is pretty  but not sure i want all the volu,Blouses
1,Tiny collar and short bodice length. lovely fabric  soft and silky.,Blouses
1,Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste. found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well. love how the flutter layer creates a different look.,Blouses
1,I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was  however  pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side  noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much,Blouses
1,This top is so pretty and the fabric is really soft...but  it does fit a little bit small in the bust. i am not extremely large busted but the buttons gap open just a little and it's tight across my back. otherwise  i love this top and the colors are really  really nice.,Blouses
1,Chambray top that is soft  but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked  the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic  almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing  and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms  and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.,Blouses
-1,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,Dresses
-1,This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it'll be retailer. but now i,Dresses
-1,This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,Dresses
-1,I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin,Dresses
-1,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.,Dresses
-1,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,Dresses
-1,I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.,Dresses
-1,I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!,Dresses
-1,I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer  but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine  but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing  but overall  just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material  not denim.,Dresses
0,I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.,Dresses
0,This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.,Dresses
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.,Dresses
0,So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.,Dresses
0,I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme,Dresses
0,Very high quality dress. there are two layers  (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight  making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.,Dresses
0,I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.,Dresses

1,5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6    i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif,Dresses
1,I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,Dresses

1,"I love this dress. be warned that even at 5'4"" it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing. i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event  dinner  or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top. it has a quiet appeal. both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it. it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable. i think some reviewers int",Dresses

1,"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality  though  as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition  as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still  a versatile dress  for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.",Dresses
1,"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose  flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",Dresses

-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
-1,A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.,Fine gauge

-1,It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.,Fine gauge

-1,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,Fine gauge
0,Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.,Fine gauge
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape,Fine gauge

0,A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,Fine gauge
0,"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of",Fine gauge
0,I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality,Fine gauge
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,Fine gauge
0,I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th,Fine gauge

0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates

1,This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra  and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps  a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense)  and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage  this bra has it all. so comfy too.,Intimates

1,I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans  but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.,Intimates

1,This is different from any bra i've had before  in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful  and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered  so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire  either  based on the s-m-l sizing  but it has one.,Intimates

-1,I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,Jackets
-1,This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.,Jackets
-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,Jackets

-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans

0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear

0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,Legwear

-1,Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,Lounge
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.,Lounge
-1,"This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher",Lounge

1,Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga  and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer  this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l  it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however  not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.,Lounge

-1,I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug,Pants
-1,Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment ,Pants
-1,I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.,Pants
-1,These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent,Pants

-1,I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.,Pants
-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.,Pants

0,I love these pants! best fitting pants i've ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don't stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn't plan well and stock enough. i bought the black  want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants  i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity.,Pants
0,I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like,Pants
0,I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store  i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on  the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy  but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that  and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low  so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides   i wante,Pants
0,"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso.

1,I'm very picky about jumpers  and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have  i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast  don't wait for it to go on sale!

1,I am here online to buy this pant in both colors. i tried it on today in store in regular lengh   but am opting for petite size. i am 5'2. i could have purchased the regular length  which hit me above the ankle  but i think p will be more flattering and better for summer.    the pants are a woven material  and kindof shiny!? the pants also may be a bit see-thru in sunshine due to the structure of weave. that said  i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional. i may,Pants
1,I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i'm 5'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay,Pants
1,I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer,Pants
-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.,Shorts
-1,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,Shorts
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,Shorts

-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts

0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.,Shorts
0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

1,The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit  they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.,Shorts

1,I absolutely love this romper. the chambray material is super comfy and easy to wear. i ordered a size up (l )  and i'm happy i did bc it would have been a little too tight in the arm area to squeeze into and gave a little extra wiggle room in the belly area. for reference i usually wear size 8/m and i'm a 34c,Shorts
1,The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly  stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs  34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric  a nice cotton twill  lined  pockets  pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!,Shorts

1,Fit true to size and very well. hit the leg at a good length. i'm 5'5. they were perfect.,Shorts
1,I got these in black and i had tried on the gray in the store  they run small at the waist. i usually wear xs or small  but i ordered a medium. they are very comfortable on a warm day. they look great with a loose  tucked in blouse or tee. the down side is they catch and the lace pulls and gets fuzzy when rubbing against things. i realized this after a day of wear. i haven't washed yet  but plan to hand wash.,Shorts
1,I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors  so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise  nice shorts for the price.,Shorts
1,"I've always had great difficulty finding a pair of shorts that i like the fit of - most are either too short  too thin  too low  or too tight. i have athletic legs that ""mainstream"" fit doesn't work well with  for the most part.    fortunately  that was not the case with the neda shorts. i was first drawn to them because of the striking but subtle pattern - and they also fit well  with a good length and a structured fit. they have a medium-high waistband and a slight stretchiness  and the fabric",Shorts
-1,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,Skirts
-1,This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.,Skirts

-1,The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,Skirts
-1,I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!,Skirts

1,This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models  but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you  retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly  without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.,Sleep

-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,Swim

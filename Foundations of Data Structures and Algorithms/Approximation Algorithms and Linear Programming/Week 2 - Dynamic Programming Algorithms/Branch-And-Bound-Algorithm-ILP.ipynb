    "# Solving ILPs using Branch and Bound Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now present how the branch-and-bound algorithm for solving integer linear programs works. Branch-and-Bound is an important and practical algorithm for solving ILPs. Together with a lot of other approaches such as _cutting planes_ and _lift and project_ methods, it forms the basis for how commercial solvers approach solving ILPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will describe a simple branch-and-bound algorithm here but note that a lot of key implementation details will be left out: they are covered in a more detailed course on the topic of linear programming/combinatorial optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer Linear Programming Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider integer programming problems of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block\" style=\"border-color:black white black white\">\n",
    "    $$\\begin{array}{rll}\n",
    "    \\max & c_1 x_1 + \\cdots + c_n x_n & \\leftarrow\\ \\text{objective function} \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathsf{s.t.} & a_{i1} x_1 + \\cdots + a_{in} x_n \\ \\leq\\ b_i & \\leftarrow\\ \\text{for}\\ i = 1, \\ldots, m \\\\ \n",
    "    & \\ell_i \\ \\leq\\ x_i\\ \\leq\\ u_i & \\leftarrow\\ \\text{for}\\ i = 1, \\ldots, n\\\\ \n",
    "    & x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\ \n",
    "    \\end{array}$$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the decision variables are all integers. Also, for convenience, we separate out the constraints that are bounds on individual decision variables so that we store the bounds for each variable $x_i$ as lower bound $\\ell_i$ and upper bound $u_i$ as shown in the third line of the problem formulation above. Note that if there is no lower bound then $\\ell_i = -\\infty$ and if there is no upper bound then $u_i = \\infty$. We will assume $\\ell_i \\leq u_i$ for all $i$ or else, the problem is infeasible right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the LP relaxation of the ILP simply drops the integrality constraint $x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and allows the decision variables to take on real-number values. \n",
    "  - This leads to efficient LP but the solution to the LP relaxation may be quite far away from the ILP solution, in general.\n",
    "  - However, if the LP relaxation yields an integer optimal solution, then it has to also be an optimal solution for the ILP.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The key idea behind branch and bound is that it solves the LP relaxation hoping that we get an integer solution. If we fail to do so, then at least one of the decision variables $x_i$ has a fractional solution say for example we get $x_i^* = 2.56639898198$ which is not acceptable. However, in the original problem $x_i$ is an integer. So we know that its value is either $\\leq 2$ or $\\geq 3$ but cannot be something in the middle. Therefore, Branch and Bound algorithm splits the problem into two problems:\n",
    "  - Original problem + constraint $x \\leq 2$.\n",
    "  - Original problem + constraint $x \\geq 3$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It recursively tackles the two sub problems and returns whichever answer is the largest since the original problem is a maximization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic branch and bound algorithm's pseudo-code is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs are the data for the ILP problem that includes:\n",
    "  - Objective Coeffients: $(c_1, \\ldots, c_n)$.\n",
    "  - LHS constraint coefficients: $\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \n",
    "  a_{11} \\ldots a_{1n} \\\\\n",
    "  \\ddots\\\\\n",
    "  a_{m1} \\ldots a_{mn}\\\\\n",
    "  \\end{array}\\right)$.\n",
    "  - RHS constant coefficients: $(b_1, \\ldots, b_m)$.\n",
    "  - Lower Bounds: $(\\ell_1, \\ldots, \\ell_n)$.\n",
    "  - Upper Bounds: $(u_1, \\ldots, u_n)$.\n",

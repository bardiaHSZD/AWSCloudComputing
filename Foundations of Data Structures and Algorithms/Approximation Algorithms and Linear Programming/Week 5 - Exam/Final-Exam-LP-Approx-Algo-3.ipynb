    "  - The time limit is strict: submissions or modifications of earlier submissions after the time limit has elapsed will not be accepted and receive no points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam is open book and notes. You are allowed to consult any course material presented in this class. However, seeking external help (searching the internet, asking others or asking a generative AI system) for solving the problems online is _strictly forbidden_. You may however consult online documentation on the python language or the pulp LP solver.\n",

    "To be clear: \n",
    "  - It is OK to consult online resources on python programming. Eg., you forgot how to implement a class in Python or you need to consult the documentation for PuLP, then it is OK to search online.\n",

    "\n",
    "A logistics company ships natural gas over trains between different places. The places form the vertices of an undirected graph and each (bi-directional) edge between two vertices denotes a rail line over which fuel can be transported by train in either direction.  We associate with each edge a cost/unit that specifies how much it costs to send one unit of oil between the two end points (in either direction). Some of the vertices are oil producing vertices where there is a net supply of oil whereas the other vertices are demand vertices where there is a net demand for oil. We will write demand as negative supply.\n",

    "### Example\n",

    "Notice that in Houston and Baltimore, there is a net supply whereas Chicago, Philadelphia and Charleston have net demands (negative supplies). \n",

    "We wish to find out how much oil to transport along each of the rail lines (edges of the graph)  so that the following constraints are met and the total transportation cost is minimized.\n",
    "\n",

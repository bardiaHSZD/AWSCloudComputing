But I wanted to show you more like a real-world example here. We have this function that is string to int. It converts strings to an integer. If you're passing like say, a string that is 1.1 will return a one. That's great, and we want to run some tests. Now, you can definitely do this with just plain functions in pytest, we'll show you a test class so here we have a test string to int. You don't necessarily need the name as string to int, you can name it anything. It has to be prefixed with test as I showed you before. But this thing has a lot of different things in here and we don't know exactly what's going on. Well, the thing is that this is one of the things that classes allows you to do, which is to do some pre-work before every single test starts and let's break it down by methods. Setup will run before every single test in a test class. Teardown will run after every single test in the test class, regardless if it passes, fails, or has a bug, or has an exception and throws an error. Setup class or setup_class will run once before every test in the test class. You can see here that I'm not using self, I'm using CLS. That is normal and that's how this thing works and he's required. Similarly, teardown_class will run once after all of the tests run in a given class. Now, I have two tests here to demonstrate. One is test around down and making sure they're 1.99 will be 2 and the test round down less or half 1.2 is two. Now there's a bug in here, doesn't matter. I still wanted to show you how these works on the terminal. In a run, test classes here, half again, by this install. This is my terminal and I'm going to run have test classes in there. I'm going to say pytest, test_classes, and when I see what's going on. All right, so I'm going to scroll all the way up here and you can see that both tests failed. That's fine. I was expecting that, tells me what the filler was. You can see here that the standard out from the setup, from the class setup is there. Then capture standard out from the teardown was also there. Now it also captures the whole thing bear per test. You can see certain things are running and getting some output out while they're running. Let's go step-by-step here. This is a setup class, perfect, runs just ones before all of the tests and then it runs setup because he's going to run these test rounds down. Then he runs the test rounds down it fails and then he runs this teardown. Then he goes on to the next test and it runs this is setup, it no longer run setup class, then runs the test, it fails, runs teardown, and then finally runs teardown class, those are there to give you flexibility on a setup or on teardown tasks that your tests might need or might benefit from. Let's make these things pass. This is going to be a one and this is also going to be a one. I'm going to save this, I'm going to run this again and we're going to have some passing. Note that when everything is passing, by this will eat out or it will omit showing you the output, which is also benefit because if everything is passing, you do not need to deal with a wall of text. When things are failing you definitely want to understand why things are failing and what the output is. This is a good way of coordinating what's happening here and you have options to do certain things before every test or before the whole of the tests in the class, or after each test, or after all the tests in a class.

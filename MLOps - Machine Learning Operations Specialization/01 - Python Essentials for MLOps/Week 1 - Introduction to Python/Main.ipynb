Python has many data structures and in fact, you can also create your own data structures with your own rules. But there are two other that I think are relevant that you might encounter every now and then. The first one is tuples and a tuple is just like a list but you need to think about it as a read-only list. We have here like I've named it, ro_items for read-only items. You have first, second, and third, and you access the indexes just like a list here. This is going to say for example, first item in the tuple is and it's going to find where first is if I run this you'll see that the index is zero for the first item and then we're going to have first, second, and third, because here it is printing. Let's take this step-by-step. First it's sprinting ro items minus one, that will give you a third. That's minus one, just like a list is the last item iterable in the tuple and then we're going to loop over just like a regular list and it will produce first, second, and third. I wanted to make this a little bit more clear and comment this one out and that one out and run this again. Then we will have first, second, and third just following the orders. It keeps the order but it doesn't allow any modification but let's see what happens if we ask for an index that doesn't exist. I'm going to run these, I'm going to get an index error, so I don't have 10 items, so the index of nine doesn't exist and that's where we get an index error. It says tuple index out of range, very similar to a list. So scrolling down here, same with indexes. If we try to get the index of an item that doesn't exist we're going to get also a value error there and then we want to know what are some of the methods available with a tuple. You have these very nifty for loop here is going to go and do some spelunking into the tuple object and find all of the methods that are available. You do that with a built in here. You only have count and index. If you remember, for a list you have a band, you have pop but that's it for tuple. Once you create one you can only count the items and get the indexes. You can't manipulate anything about a tuple. It's a read-only. You can't append. Append doesn't exist. Tuple object has no attribute append. So those are tuples. Think about them as read only list. Once you create them you can't modify them. Next is sets and sets also are like lists. We can append, we can do a lot of things there with sets but the one particular thing about sets is that it keeps things in these collection of items as unique. You can be a little bit confusing because I'm going to run this. The notation, the syntax looks like a dictionary because it uses curly brackets but there's no mapping. That means we created a set here and then we added a one which is a string and that's how we add items to a set and that created this object with a one item in there. So what happens if I keep adding the same thing? Well, I find it 1, 1, 1 and then two and you can see that the product of that operation still produces two items. That's the particularity of sets, is that it helps keep things as unique. Then you can definitely still pop items but unlike lists, pop does not take an argument, pop doesn't take any argument at all and it will just pop the first item, and in this case the first item was one over here and it was left with two. If I run this again it will produce an empty set over there, so there you have it. That's two other data structures that you might encounter aside from lists and dictionaries. â€‹ "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![](2024-02-01-23-21-15.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Using the loop keyword:**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["let mut x = 0;\n","loop {\n","    if x > 5 {\n","        break;\n","    }\n","    println!(\"{}\", x);\n","    x += 1; // Adding one to reassign the value of `x`.\n","}\n","println!(\"Loop has ended.\");"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Using if let**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["fn main() {\n","    let maybe_number = Some(42); // Wrap the integer 42 in a sum (option) enum.\n","    if let Some(number) = maybe_number { // Use pattern matching to extract the value from the option, if it exists.\n","        println!(\"The number is: {}\", number);\n","    } else {\n","        println!(\"No number was found.\");\n","    }\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Introduction**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Introduction**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Introduction**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Introduction**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Introduction**"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNAnc3IBjNxONndNFHGocAe","collapsed_sections":[],"name":"M1Assignment1 Solution.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
